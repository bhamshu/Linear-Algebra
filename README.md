Hello! I take it as my shortcoming that you ever had to come here :(
Nevertheless, now that you are here, I assume that you typed something that was not accepted or wrongly interpreted
So from here, you have these options:
1. Type the equations the way I expect them to be. I expect that:
        a) You type them in most natural way like you do when you write with hand
           **What is more natural**: -x+32y=1 or -x+32y-1=0
                   and           -x+32y=1 or -1*x+32*y=1
        **SPOILER**: The answer is the first one in both rows
        b) You are mentally fit
           Is it too much to ask? The title says "Linear Algebra" loud and clear.Yet if you are like me, you'd be
           surprised to see how many people pester my precious little code with '^'s and '/*/*'s'
           Please don't do that.
*Exceptions:
As with every statement and every discipline("except" perhaps mathematics), the current version of this program has
excptions - regarding the 'natural' way.
In a three variable system, if say the coefficient of y is zero you may want to write x+3z=4 rather than x+0y+3z=4
but you shall have to write the latter one. On similar lines, flexiblity in order of variable has not yet been achieved*

2. Wolfram
        In case you have given up hopes on me, methods better than mine already exist.
